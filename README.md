# Liver-Disease-Pred-Model-Comparision
The main objective was to select the best organization model for predicting liver ailment by carefully comparing and contrasting several classification models. The Indian Liver dataset was examined using three machine learning methods: Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). Recall, accuracy, F1 score, and precision were just a few of the metrics used to assess how well the three algorithms performed.
A dataset titled Indian Liver Patients was obtained from Kaggle for this project. There were a total of 11 attributes included in the analysis, including Age, Total Proteins, Gender, Total Bilirubin, Sgpt Alamine Aminotransferase, Sgot Aspartate Aminotransferase , Alkaline Phosphatase, Total Proteins, Albumin and Globulin Ratio, Direct Bilirubin and Result.
